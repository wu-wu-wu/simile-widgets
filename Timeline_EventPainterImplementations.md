# Event Painter Implementations #

Event Painter classes provided by default:
  1. [Timeline.Original-PainterClass](Timeline_OriginalPainterClass.md)
  1. [Timeline.Overview-PainterClass](Timeline_OriginalPainterClass.md)
  1. [Timeline.Detailed-PainterClass](Timeline_OriginalPainterClass.md)

They all expose the [event painter interface](Timeline_EventPainterClass.md), but they differ in their initialization parameters.
