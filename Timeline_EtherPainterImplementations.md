# Ether Painter Implemenations #

Ether painter classes provided by default:
  1. [Timeline.GregorianEtherPainter](Timeline_GregorianEtherPainterClass.md)
  1. [Timeline.HotZoneGregorianEtherPainter](Timeline_HotZoneGregorianEtherPainterClass.md).

They all expose the [ether painter interface](Timeline_EtherPainterClass.md), but they differ in their initialization parameters.

There is also an undocumented [Timeline.JapaneseEraEtherPainter](Timeline_JapaneseEraEtherPainterClass.md).
